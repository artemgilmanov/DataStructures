## Traverse a Tree - Introduction

### Pre-order Traversal
Pre-order traversal is to visit the root first. Then traverse the left subtree. Finally, traverse the right subtree. Here is an example:

Note: in the following animation, the highlighting in red indicates that we return from the visit of the node. The order of the visit is indicated on the array right below the binary tree.

### In-order Traversal
In-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then visit the root. Finally, traverse the right subtree.

Typically, for binary search tree, we can retrieve all the data in sorted order using in-order traversal. We will mention that again in another card(Introduction to Data Structure - Binary Search Tree).

Post-order Traversal
Post-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then traverse the right subtree. Finally, visit the root.

It is worth noting that when you delete nodes in a tree, deletion process will be in post-order. That is to say, when you delete a node, you will delete its left child and its right child before you delete the node itself.

Also, post-order is widely used in mathematical expressions. It is easier to write a program to parse a post-order expression.

You can easily figure out the original expression using the inorder traversal. However, it is not easy for a program to handle this expression since you have to check the priorities of operations.

If you handle this tree in postorder, you can easily handle the expression using a stack. Each time when you meet a operator, you can just pop 2 elements from the stack, calculate the result and push the result back into the stack.

Recursive or Iterative
Try to practice the three different traversal methods in our after-article exercise. You might want to implement the methods recursively or iteratively. Implement both recursion and iteration solutions and compare the differences between them.
