# Fundamentals of Sorting

The fundamental problem of sorting is all about ordering a collection of items. How you order these items is entirely based on the method of comparison. Suppose you needed to sort a pile of books. If you are working on a home library, you might organize it by the author’s last name. But if you need to quickly transport the books, it might make sense to initially organize them based on the size of the book. Both of these problems are sorting problems, but a key takeaway is that sorting problems are necessarily tied to a method of comparison. Different methods of comparison may lead to different results. At the most basic level, sorting algorithms are all about rearranging elements in a collection based on a common characteristic of those elements.

In computer science, we have formal definitions of sorting with respect to ordering relations.

An ordering relation has two key properties:
1. Given two elements a and b, exactly one of the following must be true: a<b, a=b, or a>b ( Law of Trichotomy ) 
2. If a<b and b<c, then a<c ( Law of Transitivity )

A sort is formally defined as a rearrangement of a sequence of elements that puts all elements into a non-decreasing order based on the ordering relation.

Suppose you were given a list of strings [“hello”, “world”, “we”, “are”, “learning, “sorting”]. One way to define an ordering relation might be based on the length of the string. One valid sort based on this ordering relation is [“we”, “are”, “hello”, “world”, “sorting”, “learning”]. For every pair of adjacent elements in the list, the length of the preceding string is always less than or equal to the length of the following string. Another ordering relation we could define is the number of vowels in the string. That would lead to the following sort: [“we”, “world”, “are”, “hello”, “sorting”, “learning”].

The ordering relation practically is defined as a method of comparison in programming languages. Most programming languages allow you to pass in custom functions for comparison whenever you want to sort a sequence of elements. In Java, for example, these are comparators. In Python, you can pass a comparison function as the key to the sort method.
