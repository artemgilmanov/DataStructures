##  Principle of Recursion
Recursion is an approach to solving problems using a function that calls itself as a subroutine.

You might wonder how we can implement a function that calls itself. The trick is that each time a recursive function calls itself, it reduces the given problem into subproblems. The recursion call continues until it reaches a point where the subproblem can be solved without further recursion.

A recursive function should have the following properties so that it does not result in an infinite loop:

A simple base case (or cases) — a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer.
A set of rules, also known as recurrence relation that reduces all other cases towards the base case.
Note that there could be multiple places where the function may call itself.

## Example
Let's start with a simple programming problem:

Print a string in reverse order.

You can easily solve this problem iteratively, i.e. looping through the string starting from its last character. But how about solving it recursively?

First, we can define the desired function as printReverse(str[0...n-1]), where str[0] represents the first character in the string. Then we can accomplish the given task in two steps:

printReverse(str[1...n-1]): print the substring str[1...n-1] in reverse order.
print(str[0]): print the first character in the string.
Notice that we call the function itself in the first step, which by definition makes the function recursive.

Here is the code snippet:
```cshrp
private static void PrintReverse(char[] str)
{
    Helper(0, str);
}

private static void Helper(int index, char[] str)
{
    if (str == null || index >= str.Length)
    {
        return;
    }
    Helper(index + 1, str);
    Console.Write(str[index]);
}
```
## Recurrence Relation

There are two important things that one needs to figure out before implementing a recursive function:

recurrence relation: the relationship between the result of a problem and the result of its subproblems.
base case: the case where one can compute the answer directly without any further recursion calls. Sometimes, the base cases are also called bottom cases, since they are often the cases where the problem has been reduced to the minimal scale, i.e. the bottom, if we consider that dividing the problem into subproblems is in a top-down manner.
Once we figure out the above two elements, to implement a recursive function we simply call the function itself according to the recurrence relation until we reach the base case.

To explain the above points, let's look at a classic problem, Pascal's Triangle:

Pascal's triangle are a series of numbers arranged in the shape of triangle. In Pascal's triangle, the leftmost and the rightmost numbers of each row are always 1. For the rest, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row.

Here's the illustration of the Pascal's Triangle with 5 rows: Given the above definition, one is asked to generate the Pascal's Triangle up to a certain number of rows.
